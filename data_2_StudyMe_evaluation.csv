- I am not 100% sure that the outcome collection is set up in a way that is temporarily consistent with the treatment schedule. For example, I wanted to do an experiment in which the exposure is dinner time and the outcome is a sleep quality index. Of course the outcome needs to be recorded after the sleep, therefore the subsequent morning. I am not 100% sure I managed to set this up since the app asks me to enter my sleep index (because I used 10 am as time for outcome collection) but clearly the exposure did not happen yet. "

Also, I was a bit confused about the ""would you like to compare"" option; maybe this could be asked in the beginning, so that I can think about the study design before, but not sure if it would help. Maybe this confusion was only because I had no specific experiment in mind before and this option was not clear to me before."
