Pushing the rationale further, health is a key factor in performance (I use the term very broadly) and wellbeing. Wellbeing is subjective, but ultimately how individuals track the degree to which they are making good use of their lives.;"Right now I'm focused on the blood markers identified by Levine et al. 2018 [Levine ME, Lu AT, Quach A, Chen BH, Assimes TL, Bandinelli S, Hou L, Baccarelli AA, Stewart JD, Li Y, Whitsel EA, Wilson JG, Reiner AP, Aviv A, Lohman K, Liu Y, Ferrucci L, Horvath S.

I have been using Cronometer for over a year and it's useful, but could be improved with greater flexibility in customizing values tracked. For instance, I can't easily track Strontium. Finally, I have been working on managing my homocysteine levels to promote brain health. My levels seem erratic, despite focused vit B (6, 12) therapy. ";Since there is a highly exploratory nature to all of this, I would be happy with being able to identify possible relations between behavior (diet, supplement, exercise, sleep) and blood values on the Levine and MOTS markers, as well as homocysteine.
